## Quickstart

The workflow uses [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) to manage compute and
software resources, as such nextflow will need to be installed before attempting
to run the workflow.

The workflow can currently be run using either
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or
[Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/latest/user-guide/) to provide isolation of
the required software. Both methods are automated out-of-the-box provided
either Docker or Singularity is installed.

It is not required to clone or download the git repository in order to run the workflow.

**Workflow options**

To obtain the workflow, having installed `nextflow`, users can run:

```
nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-template --help
```

to see the options for the workflow.

**Workflow outputs**

The primary outputs of the workflow include:

* a simple text file providing a summary of sequencing reads,
* an HTML report document detailing the primary findings of the workflow.
